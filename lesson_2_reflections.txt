What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A .git folder is created so you can store the metadata about the file history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is different from the working directory and repository because it is only a temporary place to hold files before you actually commit them.
