When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you need to share your code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might not want the changes in your remote to be in your production code, or might want to review the changes first before pulling.
